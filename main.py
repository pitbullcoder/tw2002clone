"""
Trade Wars-style space trading game over a MeshCore/Meshtastic radio mesh.

This module is the orchestrator: it wires the radio event loop to the
command registry, owns the player-arrival path (enter_sector and the
movement commands, which is also where mine detonation is resolved), and
re-exports the names the test suite reaches for. The bulk of the game now
lives in focused modules:

    core         shared state, command registry, Ctx, parse
    messaging    chunking + send/ack transport
    display      sector/menu rendering
    pathfinding  warp-graph traversal + escape-pod placement
    combat       mine-damage math
    trading      port trade + Stardock refit/shipyard flows
    session      single-helm lock + inactivity timeout

enter_sector stays here on purpose: it defaults its RNG to this module's
`random`, which is the seam the tests monkeypatch.
