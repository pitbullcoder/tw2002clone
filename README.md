# tw2002clone

A multiplayer space trading-and-combat game inspired by the classic
**TradeWars 2002** BBS door game, played entirely over a **MeshCore /
Meshtastic radio mesh** — no internet required. Players pilot a ship through
a 1000-sector galaxy by sending short text messages to the game's radio
node; the bot replies over the same mesh. It's built to run on a Raspberry
Pi or any Linux machine attached to a MeshCore radio, so a whole game can
live on a single low-power node out in the field.

Think of it as a persistent, off-grid BBS door: buy low and sell high
between star ports, upgrade your ship, lay mine fields, hunt other pilots,
and try not to get your hull blown out from under you.

## How you play

You interact with the game by sending it **direct messages** over the mesh
(the same way you'd DM any other node). Each message is a command; the bot
runs it and replies. A short menu is always a `menu` away.

Because a mesh link is slow and only one conversation can sensibly happen at
a time, the game uses a **single "at the helm" lock**: one player holds the
controls, and others are politely asked to wait their turn. If the active
player goes quiet (radio out of range, app closed, walked away), they're
warned and then automatically signed off so the next pilot can play.

All replies are automatically split into radio-sized chunks (≤130
characters) and sent one at a time, waiting for each to be acknowledged
before the next goes out.

## Features & mechanics

### The galaxy

* **1000 sectors** connected by two-way **warps**, generated as a
  fully-connected network (every sector is reachable from any other).
* About **20% of sectors have a port**. Most ports trade commodities; one
  special **Stardock** sits at the home sector (Sector 1).
* **Complementary port pairs**: at least 5% of ports are placed as adjacent
  pairs where one buys exactly what the other sells, giving traders a
  reliable shuttle run for profit.
* **Safe zone (Sectors 1–10)**: these sectors are **fully interconnected**
  (every one warps directly to every other, so the Stardock can't be walled
  off), and they're protected — **no mines and no combat** are allowed
  inside. New pilots get a safe runway to find their feet.

### Turns & time

* You start with **1000 credits**, a free **Falcon**, and **100 turns**.
* **Each sector you move into costs one turn.** Trading, docking, scanning,
  and fighting are free.
* Turns **refill to 100 once a day at 3:00 AM Eastern** (daylight-saving
  aware). The refill is checked when you sign in.
* Being relocated by *someone else's* attack (or a mine) never costs you a
  turn.

### Trading & ports

Commodities are **fuel ore, organics, and equipment**. Each commodity port
is one of eight classes describing, per commodity, whether the port **buys
from you** or **sells to you**. Selling prices are deliberately set below
buying prices across the galaxy, so shuttling goods between complementary
ports yields a margin instead of relying on luck.

Dock with `p` (port). Trading is a **guided sell-then-buy flow**: the port
walks you through each commodity, your free cargo holds are recalculated
after every transaction, and you can `cancel` at any point or skip a single
item.

### Ships & the Stardock

Nine buyable hulls, plus the escape pod you can't buy. Prices climb with
capability, but the heavy hulls are **sidegrades, not strict upgrades** —
each specializes in something (fighters, shields, mines, or cargo), so the
"best" ship depends on how you play. Figures below are each hull's **maximum
upgradeable capacity**.

| Ship | Class | Price | Holds | Fighters | Shields | Mines | Probes | Role |
|------|-------|------:|------:|---------:|--------:|------:|-------:|------|
| **Falcon** | Frigate | free | 75 | 50 | 200 | — | 10 | The free starter; balanced all-rounder. |
| **Kestrel** | Corvette | 8,000 | 40 | 120 | 150 | — | 25 | Cheap, nimble scout — best probe range in the fleet. |
| **Mule** | Fleet Tender | 40,000 | 120 | 5 | 250 | — | 10 | Entry-level hauler; lots of cargo, almost no guns. |
| **Barracuda** | Destroyer | 120,000 | 60 | 900 | 1,200 | 20 | 15 | Aggressive mid-tier warship with a small mine bay. |
| **Nautilus** | Minelayer | 180,000 | 80 | 400 | 1,000 | 150 | 15 | Mine specialist — the biggest mine bay anywhere; starts with 10 mines. |
| **SS Endeavour** | Merchant Freighter | 200,000 | 200 | 10 | 400 | — | 10 | Serious cargo hauler; weak guns. |
| **Hornet** | Fleet Carrier | 350,000 | 50 | 3,000 | 800 | — | 20 | Fighter glass-cannon: out-guns everything, thin shields. |
| **Vanguard** | Battlecruiser | 450,000 | 70 | 1,500 | 5,000 | 30 | 20 | Shield tank: the toughest hull to crack. |
| **Bismark** | Capital Ship | 500,000 | 125 | 2,000 | 3,500 | 50 | 20 | The flagship all-rounder — strong everywhere. |
| *Escape Pod* | Escape Pod | n/a | — | — | — | — | — | Where you end up when your ship is destroyed. Not for sale. |

Several hulls — the **Barracuda, Nautilus, Vanguard, and Bismark** — carry a
**mine bay**; the others can't lay mines at all. Ships start with base stats
well below these maximums and are upgraded toward them at the Stardock (the
Nautilus is the one hull that comes with mines already aboard).

Ship stats and prices (and most other balance numbers) live in
`SHIP_CATALOG` in `db.py`, so they're easy to tune for your own game.

At the **Stardock** (Sector 1) you can:

* **Refit** your current ship — buy extra cargo holds, fighters, and shields
  up to that hull's maximums.
* Visit the **shipyard** to buy a different hull or sell your current one.
* Buy **probes** (recon drones) for scouting.

### Navigation

* Type a **sector number** to move. Adjacent sectors are a single warp.
* For a distant sector, the game **plots the shortest route** through the
  warp network and walks you hop-by-hop, asking you to confirm each jump.
* You can **dock mid-route** (`p`) — trade or refit at a port you pass
  through — and then continue the same plotted course without re-plotting.

### Combat

* Attack another pilot in your sector with `a <name>` (or just `a` if only
  one other ship is present). Combat is **not allowed in the safe zone
  (Sectors 1–10)**.
* You're asked **how many fighters to commit** — send a number, `all`, or
  `cancel`. Fighters you hold back are never at risk.
* Resolution: your fighters clash with the defender's first (you spend
  ~0.75 of a fighter per enemy fighter destroyed); any survivors then strip
  **shields** (about 10 shields per leftover fighter). A ship is destroyed
  only when **both** its fighters and shields are gone.
* The **sector info screen shows other ships' fighter counts but never
  their shields** — you can size up a target's firepower, but their shield
  strength stays hidden until you actually trade shots.
* When you destroy a ship, the pilot ejects into an escape pod and drifts
  off — **you are not told where they went.** They have to be hunted down.

### Mines

* Only ships with a **mine bay** (the Barracuda, Nautilus, Vanguard, and
  Bismark) can carry and lay mines. Lay them with `lay <n>`.
* **No mines may be laid in the safe zone (Sectors 1–10).**
* When a pilot enters a sector holding mines that aren't their own, **all of
  them detonate at once**. Each mine does 1–10 damage, which cascades
  through shields, then fighters, then the hull.
* Your own mines never detonate on you.

### Death, escape pods & resets

* A destroyed **ship** ejects its pilot into an **Escape Pod**, which drifts
  4–6 warps away. Cargo and the hull are lost; **credits are kept**.
* Finishing off someone who's **already in a pod** — or running a pod into a
  mine field — is a **total reset**: back to a fresh Falcon at the Stardock
  with credits reset to 20,000. A pod has no defenses, so it's fragile.
* A pilot flying a pod can trade it in for the free Falcon at any Stardock —
  the intended way to climb back out.

### The public kill log

When you sign in, you're shown a **public log of every kill since you last
played** — both player-vs-player combat kills and kills by mines. Brand-new
players only see kills from when they first joined onward. (The most recent
entries are shown, with a count of any older ones, to keep it radio-sized.)

### While-you-were-away notices

Separately from the public log, if you personally were attacked or destroyed
while signed off, you get a private briefing of what happened to you the next
time you sign in.

## Setup & hosting (Raspberry Pi / Linux)

### What you need

* A **Raspberry Pi or Linux machine** (anything that runs Python 3.9+).
* A **MeshCore radio** flashed with the **USB Companion** firmware,
  connected to the host over USB.
* **Python 3** with `venv`, and the **`meshcore`** Python package.

### 1. Serial port & permissions

The bot connects to the radio over a USB serial device. By default it
expects **`/dev/ttyACM0` at 115200 baud** (see the `MeshCore.create_serial`
call near the bottom of `main.py`). Plug in the radio and confirm the device:

```bash
ls /dev/ttyACM* /dev/ttyUSB*    # find your radio's device node
```

If it shows up as something other than `/dev/ttyACM0` (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0`),
edit that line in `main.py` to match.

On most Linux distros / Raspberry Pi OS you also need permission to read the
serial port. Add your user to the `dialout` group once, then log out and
back in (or reboot):

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout "$USER"
```

### 2. Time zone data

Turn resets happen at 3:00 AM **Eastern**, which relies on the system time
zone database. Minimal images sometimes lack it:

```bash
sudo apt install tzdata     # Debian / Raspberry Pi OS
# or, inside the venv: pip install tzdata
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install meshcore
```

(Re-run `source venv/bin/activate` in any new shell before using the tools
below.)

### 4. Generate the galaxy (one time)

This builds the sectors, warps, and ports. Run it **before** the first
launch:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python galaxy.py
```

> ⚠️ Re-running `galaxy.py` **wipes and regenerates** the entire map. Players
> keep their credits, cargo, and ship, but the whole port/warp layout
> changes. It prompts for confirmation first.

### 5. Run the game

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

You should see `Connected OK` and then `Bot is running...`. The game now
listens for player messages over the mesh. All player and game data is
stored in a local SQLite file (`meshcore_messages.db`) in the project
directory.

### Keeping it running

`main.py` is a long-lived process, so on a headless Pi you'll want it to
survive your SSH session. The simplest option is a terminal multiplexer:

```bash
sudo apt install tmux
tmux new -s tw2002
source venv/bin/activate && python main.py
# detach with Ctrl-b then d; reattach later with: tmux attach -t tw2002
```

For an always-on node, a small **systemd** service that runs
`venv/bin/python main.py` from the project directory (with
`Restart=on-failure`) works well and will start the game on boot.

---

## Testing

The project ships with unit and integration tests. The main suite stubs out
the database for fast, isolated tests; the `db` and `galaxy` suites run
against a throwaway SQLite file.

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python main_test.py      # game logic (commands, combat, navigation, kill log, ...)
python db_test.py        # database-level behavior (turns, kill log, presence)
python galaxy_test.py    # galaxy generation (port pairs, safe-zone connectivity)
```

The codebase is kept clean under [pyflakes](https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/):

```bash
pip install pyflakes
python -m pyflakes *.py
```

## Project layout

The game is split into focused modules:

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| `main.py` | Entry point, radio wiring, command handlers, sign-in flow. |
| `core.py` | Shared game state, the command registry, and the message context. |
| `db.py` | SQLite schema, all persistence, and the game-balance constants. |
| `galaxy.py` | One-time generation of sectors, warps, and ports. |
| `trading.py` | Port trading and the Stardock refit / shipyard flows. |
| `combat.py` | Pure combat & mine-damage math (no database access). |
| `pathfinding.py` | Warp-graph routing and escape-pod placement. |
| `display.py` | Rendering sector info and menus into text screens. |
| `messaging.py` | Splitting replies into radio chunks and the send/ack transport. |
| `session.py` | The single-player "at the helm" lock and inactivity timeout. |
| `*_test.py` | The test suites described above. |
