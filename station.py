Player-built space stations: deploying a Station Core kit, and the
owner-only dock flow for arming and managing a station (depositing
materials, transferring fighters, powering shields, setting posture, and
upgrading). The combat itself -- a station shooting an entrant, or a
player attacking a station -- lives in main.py alongside the rest of the
combat code; this module is the construction/management side.
