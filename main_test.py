"""
Unit tests for the guided port-trading flow in main.py.

Centerpiece scenario (matches the worked example from the design
discussion): a trader docks at an SSB port carrying 15 units of
Equipment, with 5 free cargo holds and 10,000cr.

    1. Port offers to sell Equipment (it buys what they're carrying) --
       player sells 5 units, freeing up cargo space.
    2. Port then offers to buy Fuel Ore, now that more holds are free --
       player buys 5 units.
    3. Port offers to buy Organics with the remaining free holds --
       player buys 5 units, filling the hold completely.
    4. The port visit ends on its own once nothing's left to offer.

A couple of supporting tests cover the related behaviors discussed
alongside it: replying with a quantity of 0 (or 'no' at the price-confirm
step) skips to the next item rather than ending the whole visit, while
'cancel' ends it immediately.

This stubs out the `db` and `meshcore` modules main.py imports from, so
it runs standalone -- no real database, radio, or network needed. Run it
with either of:

    python3 main_test.py
    python3 -m unittest main_test -v

It expects main.py to be importable from the same directory.
