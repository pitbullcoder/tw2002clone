"""
Foundational game state and the command registry, shared by every other
module. Kept dependency-light (only the db layer) so nothing here imports
a feature module -- that's what keeps the package free of import cycles.

The PENDING_* dicts are the single source of truth for in-progress player
flows; main.py re-exports and clears them on (re)load, so the test suite's
importlib.reload(main) still resets state cleanly even though the dicts
physically live here.
